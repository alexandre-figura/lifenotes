Gnome Desktop Entries

Where to find my Gnome desktop entries?
=======================================

Have a look in ``~/.local/share/applications``. All entries belonging to your user are here.

Entries shared by all users are in ``/usr/share/applications``.

*Note: this was true on Archlinux and Gnome 3.16.*
